# Battle-Ship
this SHOULD work in lenux(if i spelled it wrong spam issues till i fix it) the thing that maby wont work is because this clears the screen then reprints the battleship board along with some other stuff
# There Are Probably Tons of bug and\or error 
so just spam issues till i fix nything like that
# if you want to add a ship to be used in the game you need to copy the format of the other ones

so to add a ship simple do this:
```
ships['<ship-name>'] = [<amount-of spaces>, False]]
```
always keep the second item in the array `False` otherwise it wont allow you to use the ship
and make sure that you do this after `ships` is defined :-)
